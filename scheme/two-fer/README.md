# Two Fer

Welcome to Two Fer on Exercism's Scheme Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Introduction

In some English accents, when you say "two for" quickly, it sounds like "two fer".
Two-for-one is a way of saying that if you buy one, you also get one for free.
So the phrase "two-fer" often implies a two-for-one offer.

Imagine a bakery that has a holiday offer where you can buy two cookies for the price of one ("two-fer one!").
You go for the offer and (very generously) decide to give the extra cookie to a friend.

## Instructions

Your task is to determine what you will say as you give away the extra cookie.

If your friend likes cookies, and is named Do-yun, then you will say:

```text
One for Do-yun, one for me.
```

If your friend doesn't like cookies, you give the cookie to the next person in line at the bakery.
Since you don't know their name, you will say _you_ instead.

```text
One for you, one for me.
```

Here are some examples:

| Name   | Dialogue                    |
| :----- | :-------------------------- |
| Alice  | One for Alice, one for me.  |
| Bohdan | One for Bohdan, one for me. |
|        | One for you, one for me.    |
| Zaphod | One for Zaphod, one for me. |


## Track Specific Notes

One way to get optional arguments in scheme is by specifying the arguments as a list\.
Two ways to do that are: `(define (two-fer . args) ...)` or `(define two-fer (lambda args ...))`\.

## Running and testing your solutions


### From the command line

Simply type `make chez` if you're using ChezScheme or `make guile` if you're using GNU Guile\.
Sometimes the name for the scheme binary on your system will differ from the defaults\.
When this is the case, you'll need to tell make by running `make chez chez=your-chez-binary` or `make guile guile=your-guile-binary`\.

### From a REPL

* Enter `(load "test.scm")` at the repl prompt\.
* Develop your solution in `two-fer.scm` reloading as you go\.
* Run `(test)` to check your solution\.

### Failed Test Cases

If some of the test cases fail, you should see the failing input and the expected output\.
The failing input is presented as a list because the tests call your solution by `(apply two-fer input-list)`\.
To learn more about `apply` see [The Scheme Programming Language -- Chapter 5](https://www.scheme.com/tspl4/control.html#./control:h1)
